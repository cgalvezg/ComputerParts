# ComputerParts
Using OOP 

In this project we can see the use of OOP. We have a computer with different parts (keyboard, mouse, monitor...) and a parent class InputDevice (inheritance), to show how we can use OOP on a real object.

There is a simple Test class in which we create X objects and the program prints an array of the objects created before.
